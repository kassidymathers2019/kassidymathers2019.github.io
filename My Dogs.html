     	<h3> Trixie is my oldest dog. She is now 13 years old. Lucky number 13. She is a pomeranian and is very independent. Gus is a goldendoodle. We got him second. He is the perfect dog. He is the kindest and most gentle dog you'll ever meet. Finn is our most recent addition to our family. He is a goldendoodle as well. Unlike previous pets, Finn is a wild card. Although lovable, he is absolutely insane. In the picture of him, you can tell he is about to stir up some trouble.</h3>
