<h3> Florida is always amazing, but this trip was the first time I went to Universal. It was not a disappointment. All the rides were awesome, there is a large variety of food choices, and I had a wonderful time with my mom and aunt. It is definitely worth a visit. If you are a big fan of Harry Potter you should definitely check it out! </h3>
