	<h3>We had lots of fun at the Wax Museum, but really every place and thing we did in New York was amazing. The Broadway Show we went to was incredible. We saw Mean Girls. Everyone on stage is so incredibly talented. The 9/11 Memorial is so powerful. It is something that you will never forget seeing.
